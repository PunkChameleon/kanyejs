kanyejs
=======

Imma let you finish, but this javascript program is the best javascript program of all time!

**How to Use:**

Download and include the kanye.js script in any website.

Now, from within any of your scripts call any of these functions:

     1. Kanye.motivate();
         - Kanye logs motivational sayings of his into your console.

     2. Kanye.yell();
         - Kanye logs angry things in your console.

     3. Kanye.boast();
         - Kanye logs how awesome Kanye is.

     4. Kanye.takeOver();
        - Replaces all the images in your website temporarily with a picture of Kanye.

     5. Kanye.draw();
        - Draws some awesome art in your console.

You can also pass a callback function that takes a quote to `motivate`, `yell`, or `boast` to do whatever you want with it.
